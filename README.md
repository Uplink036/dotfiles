### VSCode

VSCode is a nice code editor i use. To download the repostiry sign and install it through upt, you can run the `install_code.sh` script.

### Gnome Exstension

GNOME Exstensions provide many useful utils for Ubuntu, such as caffiene. 

### BASH
Run make bash to place the config in the right place. Next time you open your terminal every keybinding and tmux will be in place. 

### TMUX
Run `make tmux` to place the config in the right place. Then you have install the plugins by pressing `prefix` + `I`, which in our case is `ctrl`+`space`+`I`.
